				Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs's board as an outside director in January 2000: a year later she became
				president of
				Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much
				eroticism. But by
				the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman's compensation committee; how could she
				have let
				those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The
				position was
				just taking up too much time, she said.

				Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on
				a firm's board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough
				independence to
				disagree with the chief executive's proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors
				should be
				able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000
				different
				directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to
				the
				next.
				The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those "surprise"
				disappearances
				by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise departure, the probability that the
				company
				will
				subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal
				class-action
				lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger
				firms.
				Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it
				does
				not mean
				that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they "trade up." Leaving riskier, smaller
				firms
				for
				larger and more stable firms.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their
				reputations
				if they
				leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time
				any
				wrongdoing
				occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives.
				Otherwise
				outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.
